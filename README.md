<h2>Set overview</h2>
<p>The RainbowVail is made up of two parts. The first part is the goggle set,
which contains the actual lights and the Arduino Nano board. In the prototype
the Nano board is attached to the goggles along with the set of two Adafruit
addressable LEDs. The Nano board contains a definition of the basic light patterns,
the building blocks of the light sequence. These light patterns are activated in a configurable sequence by the sequencer run from Raspberry Pi. The configuration of the sequence would determine parameters such as flicker frequency or level.</p>
